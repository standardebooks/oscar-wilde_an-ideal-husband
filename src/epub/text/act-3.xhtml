			<p>The Library in Lord Goring’s house. An Adam room. On the right is the door leading into the hall. On the left, the door of the smoking room. A pair of folding doors at the back open into the drawing room. The fire is lit. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Phipps</b>, the butler, is arranging some newspapers on the writing-table. The distinction of <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Phipps</b> is his impassivity. He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler. The Sphinx is not so incommunicable. He is a mask with a manner. Of his intellectual or emotional life, history knows nothing. He represents the dominance of form.</p>
